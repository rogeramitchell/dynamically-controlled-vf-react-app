# Dynamic Page Mapping with Visualforce and React
Allow administrators to control the layout of Visualforce pages based on **Field Sets** and a **Custom Metadata Type** that has a collection of field sets relevant to their Visualforce page.

The goals of this project:

- Allow non-devs to control the view layer of a Visualforce page
- Allow developers to receive app state from configurable settings
- Allow end users to benefit from translated labels in their org
